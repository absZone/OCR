            <p style="font-size:15px" >The information technology industry employs nearly 6 million individuals across a range of industries, from technology to healthcare, finance and education. As an occupational field, information technology is projected to be one of the fastest growing in the nation, collectively producing 18 percent additional job openings nationally between 2012 and 2022. The following page serves as a high-level introduction to information technology, from the trends and drivers impacting change, overviews of career avenues and earning potential, as well as a discussion about landing a job in the industry.</p>
            <br><h1>WHAT IS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY?</h1><br>
            <p style="font-size:15px">The information age has ushered in advances in computer and communication technology, advances that have sparked what has been termed the “information revolution.” At the heart of this revolution is the exponential demand for access to, management of, and transformation of information. Information technology drives the dynamic information infrastructure that has become integrated on a global scale socially, culturally, and economically. Databases. Apps. Computer software. Websites. Mobile data. Servers. Voice networks. Each part of the larger, interconnected informational ecosystem.
Broadly, information technology can be defined as the use of computing via various components (e.g. hardware, services, software) to develop, manage, transform, share and store information in different forms. Example components of information technology include the following:

    <br>SERVICES
Systems deployment, support, repair

<br>SOFTWARE
Mobile applications, network security, desktop applications

<br>INFRASTRUCTURE
Cloud computing, Internet, telecommunications

<br>HARDWARE
Servers, mobile devices, network systems, computers

Careers in information technology deal with the design, creation, management and maintenance of the varied components of the system, including software, hardware, networks, systems integration and multimedia. Broadly, information technology can be divided into four central pathways: network systems, information support and services, programming and software development, and Web and digital communication. Down each career avenue exist myriad occupational opportunities, ranging from database administrator to computer systems engineer, digital media specialist to systems analyst.NETWORK SYSTEMS.

<h1>THE RISE OF CAREERS IN THE IT FIELD</h1>
<p style="font-size:15px">At the end of 2014, there were more than 1 billion websites on the Internet. Globally, eMarketer projects there will be more than 2 billion smartphone users by 2016. In 2014, Apple sold 13.27 million iPads, 5.20 million iPhones, 4.41 million Macs and 2.96 million iPods – in the 3rd quarter of the year alone. The three most valuable brands in the world? Apple, Microsoft and Google. Start-up Snapchat is floating a $19 billion valuation in 2015; Dropbox, $10 billion; and Uber, $42 billion. During the last two decades, advancements in technology have started to make one thing crystal clear: nearly anything is possible.

Workplace boundaries have dissolved thanks to wireless connections, tele- and web-conferencing. Data has become a commodity and technology is moving from the desktop to watches and eyeglasses. These technological advancements have created a world of endless possibilities where the exchange of information has become sacrosanct and the world has become slightly smaller.

According to CompTIA’s “IT Industry Outlook 2015” report, the IT sector employs more than 5.7 million workers in both technical and non-technical occupations. Approximately 4.88 million of that number can be attributed to technical IT occupations that are found in departments across every industry in the world. Of the global IT industry, the major segments consist of telecom services (44 percent), IT hardware (27 percent), IT services (18 percent) and software (11 percent). By percentage growth, CompTIA notes the career fields experiencing the largest employment gains in 2014 included Web developers, information security analysts, computer systems analysts, software developers (applications, and software developers (systems software).

The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects an increase of 18 percent in all computer occupations nationally between 2012 and 2022. However, within the information technology space, some jobs are expected to fare better than others. Below is an overview of three IT career paths expected to see even more accelerated growth between 2012 and 2022:</p>
<h1>INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYSTS</h1>
<p style="font-size:15px">Experts in network and computer security, information security analysts handle all aspects of network security including encryption, firewall administration and network protocols, and may handle a variety of responsibilities from developing security policies to conducting risk assessments and security audits, or from recommending upgrades to data systems security to dealing with data security breaches.</p>
<h1>WEB DEVELOPERS</h1>
            <p style="font-size:15px">Web developers have extensive understanding of Web technologies, applications and coding tools such as JavaScript, HTML, AJAX and PHP. Example responsibilities include developing Web-based applications, writing site code, integrating back-end systems and providing technical assistance.</p>

            <h1>BUILDING A NEW GRID: EMERGING IT CAREER FIELDS</h1>
            <p style="font-size:15px">For the foreseeable future, the demand of highly skilled IT professionals is expected to outpace the supply, according to human resource consulting firm Robert Half. Specifically, Robert Half predicts companies will be seeking talent in three major areas: big data, security and mobile. The reason? Employers across industry sectors have built those three areas into the core components of their infrastructure, products and services. In turn, what does this mean for the current information technology industry? It’s undergoing a transformation.

            <br>MOBILE
The impact of mobile technology cannot be understated as it is altering digital, economic and social landscapes on a global scale. Consider research from Boston Consulting Group: In 2014, mobile technologies generated approximately $3.3 trillion in global revenue. Mobile apps and content produced $530 billion in revenue and the sale of mobile devices neared the $1 trillion dollar mark globally in 2014. Venture capital investments in mobile technologies doubled between 2010 and 2014 and now comprises nearly 8 percent of all venture capital investments. In short, the increasingly mobile world is placing great demands on companies to adjust, launch new products and develop mobile-centric infrastructures and content – all of which means IT professionals can expect to see increases in job employment and compensation in mobile-focused positions.

<br>DATA SECURITY
In 2014, a data security breach exposed 56 million credit card numbers, while a data attack on Target in 2013 led to the exposure of another 40 million credit cards. Emerging IT fields, including cloud computing, virtualization and bring-your-own-device have boosted the now $60 billion dollar IT security industry. The field sits poised for exponential growth with the ever-expanding needs for encryption, authentication, certificate management, firewall infrastructures and anti-malware. Not surprisingly, IT professionals in this space – such as data security analysts, network security administrators and systems security administrators – are all in high-demand.

<br>BIG DATA
The latest hulking IT industry is big data. The ability to transform massive quantities of raw data into actionable insights has become paramount in the global economic arms race. Getting the data is one thing; harnessing its power is another. Businesses around the world require trained, skilled and talented professionals who understand how to retrieve, analyze, digest and report on that data. Projected to be a $125 billion dollar industry by the International Data Corporation, big data has introduced a wave of new terms, processes and markets, including the Internet of Things, machine learning, automated decision-making and text mining. What does that mean for the IT professional? By 2018, IDC projects there will be 181,000 “deep analytics” roles in the U.S. and nearly 1 million positions requiring data management and interpretation skill sets.</p>
<h1>TOP EMPLOYERS IN IT CAREERS</h1>
            <p style="font-size:15px">CompTIA reports that the IT industry, logically, employs the largest number of information technology workers, while other major industries include finance and insurance, information, government and manufacturing. At the business level, IT professionals can pursue a range of employment opportunities in industries ranging from healthcare to banking, retail and human resources. A review of reports from Fortune, Forbes and Dice Holdings, Inc. reveals some of the top employers seeking IT professionals in 2015 include the following:

DeloitteCapital One FinancialPublix Super MarketsCiscoGoogleGoldman SachsAccentureMayo ClinicAmazonOracle
MicrosoftFacebook</p>



<h1>AN IT TECH’S TOOLBOX</h1>
            <p style="font-size:15px">Across the board, information technology professions are technical-skill-focused, requiring proficiency in specialized areas of training. IT shares common skill areas including problem solving and task management, project management and troubleshooting. As process-based occupations, other skills have been identified to routinely appear across IT fields, including development, documentation, analysis and design, testing and implementation, according to the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET).

Yet, as NWCET reports, IT skills indeed differ across various position and occupational fields. However, employers typically seek candidates who think systematically and can solve problems through methodical approaches, conduct research, develop a series of rational solutions, test solutions effectively, verify problems are solved, and document the solution. Further, NWCET divides IT skills into three general categories: employability skills, technical skills and industry-specific skills.

<br>EMPLOYABILITY
Includes universal skills and foundational abilities to apply technical knowledge in each IT field. Example skills include:

Communication
Organization
Critical Thinking
Decision Making
TECHNICAL
<br>Includes common skills applicable not only across IT, but to individual career clusters. Example core skill areas include the following:

<br>Programming languages
Computer software and hardware
System architecture
Internet principles
<br>INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC
These skills are unique to career clusters, specific occupations, or industries, demonstrating the IT professional’s advanced understanding of their field of practice. Example industry-specific skill areas include:

Compliance standards and protocols
Vendor specific certification
Industry-specific terminology
Company or industry practices</p>
<h1>SALARIES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h1>
            <p style="font-size:15px">Multiple salary surveys all point to the same conclusion: both confidence and salaries are on the rise for information technology professionals. Consistently been on the rise, multiple IT careers pay on average salaries north of $85,000 per year according to the BLS.

<h1>THE IT JOB SEARCH</h1>

            <p style="font-size:15px">Even though information technology professionals are in increasing demand doesn’t mean landing a position will be a walk in the park. Increased demand leads to one thing: increased competition. However, getting your foot in the door is important in information technology as opportunity and career advancement possibilities abound. Aspiring tech professionals may want to temper their sights as not everyone can work for Google or Apple, but gaining entry-level work experience can lead to positions at a technology leader or the country’s hottest start-up. Here are a few steps to finding and earning that dream IT position.

            <br>EARN CERTIFICATION
Together with work experience, certification has long been the norm in the information technology industry. Although no longer a surefire way to gain employment, certification does demonstrate a candidate’s advanced skills and understanding of their area of practice (usually vendor-specific).

<br>NETWORK
There are multiple avenues to professional networking in information technology, from making connections on LinkedIn to attending conferences, joining industry associations and participating in local or regional events.

<br>COMPLETE AN INTERNSHIP
Internships – even at small companies – provide experience and skill-building opportunities and may even be leveraged into full-time positions. For individuals lacking significant work experience, an internship is one way to start building a resume.

<br>START SMALL
Prospective IT professionals should not shy away from taking an entry-level position. Everyone has to start somewhere, especially new graduates. Those early jobs afford the opportunity to get a foothold in the industry, develop technical proficiencies, make connections and gain relevant experience.

<br>TAILOR THE RESUME
Not all jobs have the same requirements or are looking for the same skill set in Web development or network architecture. That means a general resume won’t cut it. Take the time to tailor the resume to the specific organization and position, instead of relying on a shotgun, one-size-fits-all approach.

<br>PREPARE FOR THE INTERVIEW
At its core, the interview is actually a financial transaction. The candidate is selling his or herself to the company in exchange for a salary. In turn, preparation to make the sale and close the deal is vital. Preparation can be distilled into three components: 1) Know the organization; 2) Know the position; and 3) Refresh the skill-set.

<br>KNOW THE ORGANIZATION
Take the time to research the organization, its history, its products and services, and its leadership. Learn about the industry’s vertical. Who are the competitors? What about the track record of the organization’s growth and success? Being a prepared candidate leads to confidence and demonstrates to the interviewer they are diligent, organized and care about the position.

<br>KNOW THE POSITION
Research the technical requirements of the position. Are there unfamiliar technical skills or terminology listed in the job description? For example, if the candidate is not fully versed in C++, they may want to take the time to brush-up on their knowledge. Being a prepared candidate demonstrates they both want the job and are a company fit.

<br>REFRESH THE SKILL SET
Some companies may ask candidates to take a test or demonstrate their skills through a series of technical questions. That means prospective candidates should refresh their industry knowledge, study and take the time to read practice examples for possible technical questions in their area of practice. Being a prepared candidate demonstrates they take their craft seriously and are ready to make a contribution.</p>
